# Gearbox-Assignment
CAD models for creating a gearbox with non-trivial motion. This was created for EEEN425 and was worked on with my colleague Griffin Almand. We collaborated equally on this and our individual declarations are stated below.

Griffin’s Contributions:
I was responsible for the majority of the solidworks assembly and animation. In solidworks I built the 
box and shafts that the gears attached to. I used the solidworks toolbox to create the all the gears in 
the gearbox except for the two special gears that make the relationship unique to the group which 
Jon built. After the assembly was all laid out and mated in place I developed a motion analysis 
animation that demonstrates not only the unique gear relationship for our group but also how the 
full gear box interacts and moves. Jon and I both had involvement in the overall design of the 
gearbox, the assembly formation followed this design closely.

Jonathan’s Contributions:
I was responsible for designing and building the main driving and driven gears and testing them to 
make sure they worked, this involved making the gear assembly from scratch. I also wrote the 
report, drew the diagrams, bill of materials, produced the fabrication outputs and added a few 
supplementary components to the gearbox housing with the collars. Me and Griffin jointly 
contributed to the overall design and flow of the gear box arrangement.

Summary of gear box:
The input shaft enters through the right side of the gearbox housing, this is immediately translated 
to a right-angle rotation with the axis of rotation towards the front of the housing by use of a pair of 
bevel gears. This is to seat the main driving and driven gears toward the front of the housing, so they 
are visible from the user’s perspective. On this axis is the shaft that spins the driving gear, this gear is 
a single tooth that meshes with the driven gear.
The driven gear has 6 indents at evenly spaced intervals that mesh with the single tooth so that the 
driven gear completes a 1/6th rotation with every complete rotation of the driving gear. Between the 
indents is an arc cut out that corresponds to the circumference of the driving gear, this causes the 
gear to lock while the driving gear is completing the rest of the revolution after meshing with the 
single tooth. The driven gear rotation is translated along a shaft to a pair of spur gears which in turn 
translate along a shaft to another pair of bevel gears, this produces a right-angle transmission 
upward to the top of the box, this is connected to the output shaft that extends out of the top of the 
box.
